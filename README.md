# Preparing table to work with it

What I did with the table itself:
- I split the columns from the incorrectly saved csv file,
- split the probingTimestamp column into 2 other columns and deleted the probingTimestamp column,
- I sorted the rows from the smallest values (priority) Date and Time from the smallest value to the highest value,
- I fixed the indexing of all rows after sorting.
